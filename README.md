What is this?
==============

Hi, this is just a small tool that help you visualize debugs when you are developing for VR in Unity, especially useful  when developing 
for Oculus Quest.

How to use it?
==============

The setup is really simple, just import [this](https://github.com/platinio/VR-Debug/releases/download/1.0/VR_Debug.unitypackage)  on your project, and when you want to visualize the console, just press the primary button in both hands for 3 seconds,
and a new console will be spawned just in from of you.

For toggling the debugs just use the primary joystick from your left hand, move it horizontal and you hide or show logs base on the type (warnings, errors , debug),
and use the joystick from your right hand to navigate throught the logs.

VR Debug uses XR Input from Unity, so if you want to know what is the PrimaryAxis or PrimatyButton mapping for your current VR setup just take a look at [this](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/xr_input.html).
